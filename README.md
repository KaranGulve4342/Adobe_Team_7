<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## **About The Project**

- Our study focuses on the categorization and regularization of 2D curves, notably hand-drawn forms and doodles. 


- The major objective is to create algorithms capable of reliably identifying and categorizing different geometric forms within a given set of curves. The initiative stresses the capacity to work with flawed and irregular shapes, acknowledging that hand-drawn doodles sometimes vary from ideal geometric forms. 



- The classification method entails assessing the geometric features of input curves and using pattern recognition algorithms to discriminate between several form categories such as lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, and stars. 



- Our project's focus on form categorization and regularization adds to the larger field of computer vision and image analysis, with possible applications in fields such as digital art, design tools, and educational Software

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Running the App

### Prerequisites:

* **Git:** Ensure you have Git installed to clone the repository.
* **Python:** You'll need Python to manage the project's dependencies and run Streamlit.
* **Streamlit:** Install Streamlit using `pip install streamlit`.

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KaranGulve4342/Adobe_Team_7
   cd CURVETOPIA_DA
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. **Open the App:**
    The app will open in your default browser on port 8501. You can now interact with the application and explore its features.
